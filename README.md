# Week 2 Challenge

## Making a Portfolio Website

- A portfolio that showcases the skills to potential employers needs to be developed from scratch. This challenge applies advanced CSS techniques like responsive design using flexbox and media queries along with CSS variables.

## User Story

- AS AN employer
  I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
  SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

## Acceptance Criteria

- GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
  -WHEN I load their portfolio
  THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
  -WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
  THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
  -WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
  THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
  -WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
  THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
  -WHEN I click on the images of the applications
  THEN I am taken to that deployed application
  -WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
  THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
